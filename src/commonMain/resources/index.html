<!--
(from the docs:)
This file is placed in the common resources instead of a jvm source set to make tasks for running the JS application
in the browser (jsBrowserDevelopmentRun and jsBrowserProductionRun) accessible to the file as well.
It's helpful if you need to run only the browser application without the backend.
